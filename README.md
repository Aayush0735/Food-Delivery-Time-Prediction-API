# Food Delivery Time Prediction Model

This project provides an end-to-end machine learning solution to accurately predict food delivery times. It addresses the business need for reliable ETAs to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize logistics. The final model is deployed as a high-performance REST API using FastAPI.

---
## Problem Statement

Inaccurate delivery time estimates are a major challenge in the food delivery industry, leading to a poor customer experience and inefficient driver allocation. This project builds and deploys a machine learning model to provide reliable delivery time predictions, directly tackling these issues.

## Key Features & Results

* **High-Accuracy Predictions:** The final tuned LightGBM model predicts delivery times with a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 5.6 minutes**.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** The model identified that **delivery distance**, **driver rating**, and **driver age** are the most influential factors in determining delivery time.
* **Live API Deployment:** The prediction model is served via a REST API, making it easy to integrate into any front-end application or logistics system.

## Setup & Usage

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` package manager

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Model.git](https://github.com/your-username/Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Model.git)
    cd Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Model
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Running the API

1.  **Start the server:** Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application.
    ```bash
    python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

2.  The server will start and be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoint

The API has one main endpoint for predictions.

### POST `/predict`

This endpoint accepts delivery details and returns the predicted delivery time in minutes.

* **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **Request Body (Example):**
    ```json
    {
      "Delivery_person_Age": 35,
      "Delivery_person_Ratings": 4.8,
      "distance_km": 15,
      "Type_of_order": "Snack",
      "Type_of_vehicle": "motorcycle"
    }
    ```
* **Success Response (Example):**
    ```json
    {
      "predicted_delivery_time_min": 28.33
    }
    ```
